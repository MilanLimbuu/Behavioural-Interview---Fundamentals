Running a behavioural interview means getting signal across all of the dimensions listed below. It requires having a set of questions that you trust to give you multi- faceted signal such that you end up with a mental model of the candidate that is as accurate as possible. You might only ask 5 questions, but you should be able to mesh the answers into a fairly high resolution perspective of the person. Calibration in these interviews is extremely important.

A well run behavioural interview has the following outcomes:
Decisive, multi-dimensional signal about the candidate
Feedback that cuts to the decision points, noting the strongest positive and negative signals
A candidate experience that includes feeling listened to and understood by the interviewer

Questions

Good interview questions have a specific form that is carefully chosen. They consistently yield high-signal, qualitatively valuable responses. This is an important point because even bad questions sometimes yield valuable answers, but good questions pretty much always do.
To decide if a question is good or not, use the following criteria (ordered by importance):
 Does the question give key signal about whether or not the person would be a positive contributor?
Positive contributors can be reduced down to a handful of dimensions:

clear growth potential / sufficient seniority not to need it autonomy (appropriate to their years of experience)
strong communication ability
integrity
empathy
core competence
self-awareness
passion (that is applicable to our domain)

These are roughly the key dimensions. Pedantic folks can have fun arguing about whether this list is exactly right. You get the idea. So, if your question doesn’t lead to answers that get signal across several of these dimensions all at once, it’s probably not a good question.

Does the question get the person off script?

People doing lots of interviewing will have many canned answers that they happily regurgitate on demand. As soon as someone starts reciting their litany, you’ve lost your ability to evaluate them. Good questions make it impossible for the candidate to recite canned answers. Good questions require them to do thinking in real-time. You can gauge if this is happening by looking for signals like:
long-ish pauses
clear filler noises like “um” and “ah” and “hrm”
verbal feedback like “Wow, that’s a tough question” or “I have no idea”
If you’re getting these signals (and your question is sane), you’re probably about to get good signal from the candidate.

Is the question indirect?

You should never ask a question where the signal you’re trying to get is too clear. A clear anti-pattern is something like, “Do you see yourself as a good team member?” The answer you want is obvious. It takes an incredibly self-aware, mature person to answer negatively to a question like this. Since most self-aware, mature people tend to be good team members, you’re basically never going to get useful signal out of this question.
Good questions indirect the signal you want by opening up the opportunity to have the candidate give you whatever signal they’re naturally inclined to offer up. A good counter example to the question above would be “What’s the best team you’ve been on? What made it so great?” In this formulation, the candidate is offering up their own perspective and ideas. The “good” answer space is much, much less clear. Plus, this formulation gives you the ability to ask follow-up questions that ferret out specific signals you need to get. Follow-ups might include “What role did you play in that team?” or “How was it different from teams that were less good?”

Can you cross-check the question?

In the case that you get an answer that feels squishy or dishonest, you need the ability to cross-check the answer with follow-up questions. An example of how this might play out in practice would be a question like, “Talk about a project you’ve shipped that really stretched your abilities.” Some candidates will give softball, hand-wavy answers to a question like this. Perhaps the reply might be, “My team and I delivered a redesign of <something complicated>. I worked really hard on that.” In this case, you as the interviewer must make sense of what the person did versus what the team did. Likewise, “I worked really hard” is completely hand-wavy. Did they work 60-hour weeks for months? Did they stay late one night? Did the skip their daily two-hour lunch a few times? What do they believe “hard work” is? Good questions give you plenty of room for cross-checking answers. For the “hard worker”, a good cross-check would be something like, “What specifically about the project required you to work so hard?” If their answer is, ‘Because it was hard,’ you’re getting great signal that this person is either a poor communicator or they have low integrity and are just bullshitting you.

Does the question give you concise signal?
  
Good questions let you get to the point quickly. They are short questions whose answers require cutting to the key signal straight away. It’s highly advisable to avoid asking high-level knowledge questions. We’re not here to test if a candidate has an encyclopaedic knowledge of biology. We are here to understand if the person would be good to work with over the long term.

In terms of question pacing, you should expect a question to yield a meaningful answer in at most 5 minutes. If you want to dig into the person’s answer, you might spend another few minutes on it. Most high-signal behavioural interviews will go through 4 or more questions. If you’re going through significantly more questions than that, you’re probably not digging in deeply enough. If you’re not asking at least that many, you’re probably not keeping the interviewee concise enough or you’re talking too much.

Are you calibrated on this question?
  
Asking the same question of multiple candidates gives you a much better ability to read and evaluate the answers. It’s highly recommended that you try out a few questions and build up a repertoire that you feel really confident in evaluating.

Sample Questions

Below are some sample questions. You can crib them exactly if you wish, but it’s much better to read through them, find the ones where you feel you can ask the best questions, and then form your own versions of them. Asking questions effectively is a bit of an art form. It’s highly recommended that you practice asking the question(s) you mean to ask ahead of time.

NB: You can safely assume that any of these questions will give you good communication signal.
 
What’s the best team you’ve ever worked on? What made it good?
Key signals: autonomy, growth trajectory, self-awareness, core competence
 
What sort of person do you look up to professionally? Why?
Key signals: growth trajectory, self-awareness, passion, core competence
  
What’s a misperception other people have about you? How do you know this?

What’s a time where you disagreed with your team or your manager? How did you resolve it?
Key signals: conflict resolution, integrity, empathy, core competence, collaboration
  
What’s a piece of critical feedback you’ve received that really helped you improve? 
Key signals: integrity, self-awareness, empathy, growth trajectory, collaboration

What’s a challenge you’ve faced that made you struggle?

Pro Tip: Force the candidate to talk about something from more than a year ago — gets them off script

Talk about a time where you decided work that needed to be done. How did you decide what needed to happen? What tradeoffs did you weigh?
Key signals: autonomy, seniority, self-awareness, core competence 
Pro Tip: This question only works for more senior candidates.

Evaluating the candidate
  
Determining if a candidate is a good fit is fundamentally qualitative and so very difficult to provide a rubric for. However, there are clear many negative signals to filter against. Examples include:
Insincerity / bullshittery

Excessive arrogance
Excessive deference
Clear lack of self-awareness despite ample opportunity to provide it Clear lack of core competence
Clear lack of growth trajectory
Clear lack of applicable passion for the problem domain Difficulty in communicating earnestly and off-script

One subtle signal to attend to in evaluating behavioural candidates is how you feel at the end of the interview. Are you tired? Do you feel drained? Energised? Taking a reading of your own emotional response to the candidate can be very important in qualitative evaluation.

Overall, the default answer should be a No Hire. If you come away with no reason to either hire or not hire the candidate, we should favour false negatives. Generally, lack of conclusive signal is considered interviewer error and should include some post-mortem discussion. Still, some candidates just won’t give you useful signal, which is negative signal.
